# Times of Palestine — newsroom charter for AI agents

Multiple AI agents (ChatGPT/Codex, GitHub Copilot, Claude) work on this repo on
behalf of the owner. This file records the owner's standing decisions. **Do not
undo another agent's layer to make your own change** — graft your change onto
what is there, and when two approaches conflict, open a PR and let the owner
decide rather than force-replacing files.

## Owner decisions currently in force (2026-07-29)

1. **The AI newsroom is ON — deliberately.** The build uses the Anthropic API
   in two places, and the owner has approved the cost (~$150–200/month):
   - **Briefs desk** (`build.py`, `claude-haiku-4-5`): every wire item is
     rewritten in-house before publication. Wire-first policy: an item
     publishes only when its rewrite exists, is complete, and passes the
     refusal screen. Never publish raw truncated feed summaries as articles.
   - **Investigations desk** (`originals_gen.py`, `claude-opus-5` + web
     search): files at most 3 researched bilingual reports/day at 05/12/19 UTC
     (`DESK_HOURS`). Owner-approved cadence — don't raise it without asking.
   - In `.github/workflows/build.yml` this requires: the
     `pip install anthropic` step, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` on the build step,
     `permissions: contents: write` (the desk commits its reports), and
     `INVESTIGATIONS: ${{ vars.INVESTIGATIONS }}`. **Do not remove these.**
     To pause the desk, set the `INVESTIGATIONS` repo variable to `off` —
     never hardcode `off` in the workflow.
2. **Telegram delivery** (`telegram_publish.py`, tests, delivery cache) is
   Codex's layer. Keep it; don't fold it back into `build.py`.
3. **Editorial rules:** no sources/bibliography sections in articles —
   attribution lives inline in the prose. Report the issue, never the
   individual. Both language editions are first-class; verify rendering
   changes in `/en/` and `/ar/`.
4. **Publishing safety:** event-level dedupe (one incident, one article) and
   the completeness gate (no mid-sentence bodies) in `build.py` are
   owner-requested. Markdown-residue in an original skips that article with a
   loud warning; schema and missing-media errors fail the build. Editorial
   gating must default to publish (with a label if needed) — never to holding
   coverage behind per-story manual approval.
5. **Story imagery: keep photos (owner decision 2026-07-30).** Aggregated
   stories fetch and display upstream social-preview images (og:image); story
   cards must not go photoless. Any rights-strict mode (self-owned assets
   only) is an opt-in flag, default OFF.
6. **Zero third-party Python deps in the build path** except `anthropic`
   (installed in CI). `build.py`/`longform.py` stay stdlib-only otherwise.
7. **Never commit** `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, cache/state JSON — see
   `.gitignore`. Never commit secrets; `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` live in GitHub secrets only.

## Division of labor (suggested, not exclusive)

- **Codex/ChatGPT:** Telegram delivery, workflow reliability, tests.
- **Copilot:** renderer/validator hardening via PRs (reviewed before merge).
- **Claude:** the AI newsroom layers (briefs, investigations desk), editorial
  pipeline, dedupe/completeness gates, and the daily **Washington Brief**
  (`originals/washington-brief-*` + matching SVGs in `originals/media/`) —
  a scheduled deep-research report on DC's Iran/Israel/Mideast thinking for a
  Palestinian audience. Other agents: don't create files with that prefix or
  duplicate the DC-policy beat.

Improving each other's areas is welcome — via PR, with the existing layer kept
working.

## How any agent publishes an article (the contract)

The site is fully cloud-automated: push a valid file to `originals/` on `main`
and the hourly GitHub Actions build validates, renders, deploys, and delivers
it to Telegram. No human machine involved. The contract:

1. File: `originals/<slug>.<en|ar>.txt` — publish BOTH languages as
   first-class editions. Header, then `---`, then body:
   `title:` / `category:` (one of: gaza westbank politics economy
   accountability research bitcoin diaspora arts sports social opinion news
   humans) / `date:` (ISO 8601 UTC, never future) / optional `maxAgeHours:`.
2. Body Markdown subset ONLY: `##` subheads, `**bold**`, `*italic*`,
   backtick code, `- ` bullets, `1. ` lists, pipe tables, `[text](url)`
   links, `![caption](file.svg)` images (file must exist in
   `originals/media/`). Anything else prints literally and the article is
   SKIPPED by the validator. No footnotes, no sources sections — attribution
   inline in prose. Never end mid-sentence.
3. Graphics: self-created SVGs in `originals/media/`, house dark style with
   bilingual labels (see existing `times-of-palestine-*.svg`). Never
   copyrighted images.
4. Before pushing, run `python3 build.py` and confirm `✓ original:` for your
   files. Push with fetch/rebase/retry — this repo receives frequent commits.
5. Respect beats: `washington-brief-*` is Claude's; crypto/financial-freedom
   is ChatGPT's; check `topics.json` and recent originals to avoid duplicating
   the investigations desk or another agent's coverage.
